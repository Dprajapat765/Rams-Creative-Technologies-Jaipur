Copy or move files from one dir to another dir using python.

when you have multiple files and you have to filter out by scrolling them manually
it's very time consuming.

few days ago, when I face this situation and I went for manual process
and it takes 3 days to complete this process.

Now I created this code to move or copy files by skipping them.

****************
what to do before running this code

1. set your source folder path.
2. give input of files to be skipped between of it.
3. then run the code.
