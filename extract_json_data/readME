How to extract data from multiple json files and save in text file.
**************

This is also helpful in computer vision or deep learning projects.

####
when you labelled the images to train a deep learning model,
all you labelled images saves your annotations in X or Y cordinates,
means to say when you mark or annotate or labelled an image, it saves 
your annotations in a file format like XML or JSON etc...


####
these files contains some data with X and Y cordinates,
in this program, I am going to read multiple files and
extract that cordinates and saves them in a text file,
this text file is saved as a format in which we train data 
on YOLO. 

#see example image of YOLO format.
